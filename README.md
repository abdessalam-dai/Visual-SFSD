<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

For a period of 3 months, me and a group of students built VisualSFSD during our 4th semester at <a href="https://estin.dz" target="_blank">ESTIN</a> as a multidisciplinary project.

SFSD is a shortcut term for "File & Data Structures". VisualSFSD is a web application designed to help computer science students visualize and understand file structures at the base level. It provides a set of algorithms and tools for testing and visualization. With VisualSFSD, students can gain a deeper understanding of how these concepts can be used to organize and manipulate data.

Test the application here, <a href="https://vsfsd.estin.dz" target="_blank">vsfsd.estin.dz</a>.

## Installation
To install and run VisualSFSD on your computer, you will need to have the following software and libraries installed:

1. Python 3: You will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer in order to run the application. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Django: Django is a web framework for Python that is used to build the VisualSFSD application. You will need to install Django in order to run the application. You can install Django using the following command:

```
pip install django
```

3. Other dependencies: VisualSFSD also has a number of other dependencies that are listed in the `requirements.txt` file in the repository. You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once you have installed all of the necessary software and libraries, you should be able to run the VisualSFSD application by navigating to the root directory of the repository and running the following command:

```
python manage.py runserver
```

This will start the Django development server, which will host the VisualSFSD application. You can then access the application in your web browser by navigating to <a href="http://localhost:8000/">http://localhost:8000/</a>.
